Version:	0.39 Build 584
Status		Alpha
Release Date:	05/28/2007



*Fixed	Problem displaying Zipped skins properly.
*Fixed	Black color in images are rendered as transparent.
*Fixed	Dash lockup when scrolling up in Game Manager.
*Fixed	MP3 files are now playable directly from USB FAT32 devices.

*Changed	z-buffer bit depth to 16-bit from 32-bit to decrease
		memory footprint.

*Added	"Compress Texture" in video settings. Default is Off/No/False.
	Settings this to true enables the Dash to use Texture compression
	for big images, decreasing the memory requirement to display those
	in exchange for a lesser quality image. You can set this to "Yes" if
	you are using a skin with lots of videos/images 
*Added	"Browse Folder" in Music manager. You can now select folders
	containing MP3 and WMA files and the dash will queue them
*Added	WMA playback support for ISO9660 disc/USB FAT32 devices.
	Note: Files are copied to a temp folder. File streaming in XACT
	appears to be broken so I can't play from the media source directly.


Note: 	Live Update server will only work with V0.39.0515A Build 583

	It could be that it's not USB1.1 compliant but I ran out of hardware
	to test. Tested with 128MB, 512MB, 1GB flash disk and 4GB iPod Nano. Let
	me know if you have success with bigger HDD.

		Limited to a single mounted device.

	OrangeShapes_ConstantineMP.zip. This is a skin based on OrangeShapes

Version: 0.36.0620A Build 499

*Fixed  Icon/Video assignment on the menu item editor for items other than an xbe.
*Fixed  GameIcon tag should now work again, although skinners should use the
	<Image> tag instead.
*Fixed  Minor bug when installing skin.

*Changed Flicker Filter level set to 2 by default
*Changed Soften display set to True by default
*Changed 32bit is now the default color quality again
*Changed Copy command changed back to older implementation
*Changed Modified line drawings to use native DX Render State
	 for line thickness, instead of drawing the lines several times.
*Changed Filtered the 'A' and 'Start' button to prevent the event from
	 bubbling up when screensave is active.
*Changed System Settings and put ScreenSaver in its own section
*Changed Editing the title of a menu item when it's an xbe will also edit the
	 title of the xbe.

Note:  This is a Quick fix release -some reported bugs may still exists.
Make sure your xbe, zipped skin file, custom music...etc., doesn't contain multiple 
periods (".") in its file name. It seems the search file API has a problem when 
using search filter such as "*.mp3" or "*.zip". It won't return files like 
"my.cool.song.mp3". I'll take a look on this and it's probably something wrong on my 
part, but I don't wanna take out the filter and check for the extension myself.
I'm using the standard FindFirstFile/FindNextFile API, if anyone has a tip, that
would be cool.

	get too close to the right edge.
Fxed:	Sometimes, items in a batch script executes without waiting for the current

Changed: Settings screen are now logically grouped, so it's easier to find
	 what you are looking for without having to go thru a long list.
Changed: ScreenSaver text can now accept a value pointing to a valid XMV/WMV
	 file, or a valid path containing images for slideshow with 6 different

	smoother animation.

Fixed:	Problem with the newer IR Control.
Fixed:	Background music (BGM) gets muted even though the audio of preview video is disabled.

Added:	Video mode Auto-Detect/Auto-Switch using Cherry's patch code so it's EEPROM safe (Doesn't modify and write to EEPROM). Force PAL60 option is also included.

The type of information displayed is dependent on the type of the currently selected item. The context menu will be expanded to include more actions in the future.
