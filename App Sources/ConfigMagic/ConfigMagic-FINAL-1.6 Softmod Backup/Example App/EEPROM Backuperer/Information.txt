This is a small app that is used to backup or enable the virtual eeprom on softmodded systems.

I modified the ConfigMagic v1.6 source & removed everything other than the eeprom backup stuff, I also modified it a bit for my own needs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What this App does is the following.

1)	Backs up the Xbox EEPROM.bin, EEPROM.cfg & EEPROM.txt to "E:\Backups\EEPROM\"

2)	Backs up the Xbox EEPROM.bin for Vitrual EEPROMs to "C:\NKPatcher\Configs\"

3)	Silent backup of the EEPROM.

4)	Supports launch options.

		Standalone Mode: (Standalone_Mode.enabled)
			Standalone mode makes the EEPROM Backuperer act like well a standalone app, if enabled & one of the other options are enabled, they will always stay enabled, unless removed manually.

		Virtual EEPROM Backup: (Virtual_EEPROM_Backup.enabled)
			Virtual EEPROM backup mode is used for creating a backup of your current EEPROM for use as a virtual EEPROM file, this file is stored in "C:\NKPatcher\Configs\".

		Reboot after backup: (Reboot.enabled)
			This will reboot your system after one of the above processes are complete.

		No launch options: (No .enabled files)
			EEPROM backup mode is used for backing up the EEPROM data to "E:\Backups\EEPROM\" this is the default mode of operation.
