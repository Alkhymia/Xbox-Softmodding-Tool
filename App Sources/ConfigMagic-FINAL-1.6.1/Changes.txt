Updated the Source to compile under retail, smaller xbe size.

Include wmvdecd.lib, required to compile.
( install to %PROGRAMFILES(x86)%\Microsoft Xbox SDK\xbox\lib )

Fixed the CRC size for checksum 3
( On v1.6 xbox the xbox would invalidate these settings and clear them. Potential Error16 if a softmod or stock MSDash isn't present on C ) 

Updated the skinning aspect of the code.
	You can now colour the menu and the menu header.
	Removed the horrid shadowing of the text.
	Changed all images to PNG.
	If no wmv files are found it will just skip them, no more crashing!
	( I never done this for images as well there needed )
	New Skin
	New Fonts, had to adjust font positions a tad.
	( Segoe UI )
	
Exit button changes to "Lock Your Hard Drive" when the HDD is unlocked.
( Does nothing if the HDD is unlocked, softreset or power off bypasses this obviously )

Auto refresh EEPROM after an EEPROM Update.
( Should have been this way from the beginning )

Updated XKUtils to the latest version and added the option to write the following:
	SetLanguageString
	SetVideoFlagsString
	SetAudioFlagsString
	SetTimeZoneStdNameString
	SetTimeZoneDltNameString
	SetTimeZoneStdDateString
	SetTimeZoneDltDateString
	SetTimeZoneDltBiasString
	SetNullChecksum3String

Note: These aren't added to the GUI, they would be used for advanced users only.

Other minor changes, like labels and new lables eg...
