

FontBundle

Build your own "XPR" Fonts for MXM and other homebrew Xbox Applications!

Requires FontMaker.exe and Bundler.exe in the path.


How to use? 

Run FontBundle and use it to launch the FontMaker utility. 

Select your font and save off the TGA and ABC files to a directory. 

Once that's done, "Load" the TGA file (will also bring in the ABC file).

Now "Build"

The resulting XPR file will be a Packed Resource file usable as a font in XDK-built applications
that use them.
