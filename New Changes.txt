
Update: Dec 15 2016

Some more backend changes, I modularized the 2016 Softmod Tool Kit a bit more and cleaned up its code.
Updated the other parts of the softmod to reflect these changes.
Improved the update softmod installer, now check for the presence of my softmod before running and also cleans up better.



Changes from the stable versions:

1)	Renamed EEPROM Backeruper to 2016 softmod tool kit as it does alot more than just backing up the eeprom.
2)	Changed how the hole softmod is done, I no longer use NKPatcher for disabling the shadowc partition so now you can softreset out of NKPatcher Settings.
	( I modify Unleashx during the softmod )
3)	I also changed how the ShadowC partition is created, its now created on the fly using the new tool kit above.
4)	Crap loads of edits, to many to remember :\ lets just say its almost a hole new softmod :D
	( well the backend is )
