Free FTP Programs

All work on Windows 10

Core FTP LE 2.2 : free version - ( functions like Filezilla but without any issues )
http://www.coreftp.com/download.html

Filezilla - ( has root directory issues with newer versions of UnleashX )
https://filezilla-project.org/


Note:
CoreFTP on Windows 10 will crash when drag and dropping directories onto the transfer window, To fix do the following.

1) Don't drag and drop ( :P ) kidding, but if you select the files/folders on the left window pane and right click and pick transfer it works fine.

2) Right click the "Core FTP LE" shortcut in the start menu or desktop if you have one there and pick:
   Properties > Compatibility > tick the box for "Run this program in compatibility mode for:" select Window 8 > select OK and your done.
