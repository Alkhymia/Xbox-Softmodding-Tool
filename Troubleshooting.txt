Troubleshooting:

1) FTP - root directories are malformed.
	
	Cause:
		Filezilla and newer builds of UnleashX.
		( Build 572, Build 583 and Build 584 )

	Fix:
		Use "Core FTP LE 2.2 : free version", this FTP program has no issues and functions the same as Filezilla. Alternatively, use another dashboard.
		( you can use any other FTP program, but that's the best free alternative )
		
	Reason for using the latest UnleashX build:
		It fixed a lot of skinning issues and also added new skinning features that I use in my skins.
		( there are also other fixes but those are the main ones )
		
	Why don't I use build 570:
		I don't use Filezilla and I require the fixes of build 584.



2) My G partition is missing

	Cause:
		HDD is formatted without a partition table.
		( HDD was formatted with EvolutoinX, UnleashX or Chimp 2618 or lower )
		
	Fix:
		Load "NKPatcher Settings" and select "Partition Types > Partition F and G"



3) Xbox is freezing sometimes at the XLogo screen

	Cause:
		Some rare Xbox's can randomly crash due to, exploit instability.
		
	Fix:
		Load "NKPatcher Settings" and select "Kernel Fonts > Advanced Features > Kernel Font Options > Install Kernel Font"
		
	Note:
		Please read the Information text before applying this fix.
		( the process is automated, don't worry )
