Troubleshooting:

1) FTP - root directories are malformed.
	
	Cause:
		Filezilla and newer builds of UnleashX.
		( Build 572, Build 583 and Build 584 )

	Fix:
		Use "Core FTP LE 2.2 : free version", this FTP program has no issues and functions the same as Filezilla. Alternatively, use another dashboard.
		( you can use any other FTP program, but that's the best free alternative )
		
		Note:
			CoreFTP on Windows 10 will crash when drag and dropping directories onto the transfer window, To fix do the following.

				1) Don't drag and drop ( :P ) kidding, but if you select the files/folders on the left window pane and right click and pick transfer it works fine.

				2) Right click the "Core FTP LE" shortcut in the start menu or desktop if you have one there and pick:
				   Properties > Compatibility > tick the box for "Run this program in compatibility mode for:" select Window 8 > select OK and your done.



2) My G partition is missing

	Cause:
		HDD is formatted without a partition table.
		( HDD was formatted with EvolutoinX, UnleashX or Chimp 2618 or lower )
		
	Fix:
		Load "NKPatcher Settings" and select "Hard Drive > Partition Types > Partition F and G"



3) Xbox is freezing sometimes at the XLogo screen

	Cause:
		Some rare Xbox's can randomly crash due to, exploit instability.
		
	Fix:
		Load "NKPatcher Settings" and select "Kernel Fonts > Advanced Features > Kernel Font Options > Install Kernel Font"
		
	Note:
		Please read the Information text before applying this fix.
		( the process is automated, don't worry )
